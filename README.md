This code is a simple Python script that utilizes the `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with a text entry field and a button. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. Importing tkinter: The code starts by importing all classes and functions from the `tkinter` module using the wildcard `*`. This is a common practice, although it's generally recommended to import only what you need from modules to avoid namespace pollution.

2. Creating the main application window: An instance of the `Tk` class is created, representing the main application window. Various properties like the title and geometry (size) are set for this window.

3. Creating an Entry widget: An `Entry` widget is created and assigned to the variable `inp`. This widget allows users to input a single line of text.

4. Defining a function to show the input: The `show` function is defined. When called, this function retrieves the text entered into the `Entry` widget (`inp`) and creates a `Label` widget (`msg`) with that text.

5. Creating a Button widget: A `Button` widget is created with the text "Show". When clicked, this button will execute the `show` function.

6. Running the application: The `mainloop()` method is called on the `Tk` instance (`App`), which starts the event loop and displays the GUI to the user. This method waits for events (such as button clicks or window closures) and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers.

In summary, this code creates a simple GUI application with a text entry field and a button. When the button is clicked, the text entered into the entry field is displayed as a label below the button.
